This study attempts to find patterns in a lifelogger’s daily activity and thus can be used to perform behavioral analysis as studies suggest. This study focuses on testing the efficiency of analyzing temporal segmentation of human activities in order to understand a lifelogger’s daily life pattern.

The NTCIR-14 lifelog data consists of data from wearable biometric trackers every minute along with the continual blood glucose data observed every 15 minutes from 21 days. The Dataset consists of 16 features with few substantial attributes like calories burnt, minute id, heart rate, glucose, scanned glucose, activity, location, steps, and distance.
